# kaya.sk

Personal blog and portfolio site built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Features blog posts, talk
slides (reveal.js), and a terminal-themed design with dark/light mode support.

🔗 **Live at [kaya.sk](https://kaya.sk)**

## Features

- 📝 Blog posts in Markdown/MDX with auto-discovery
- 🎤 Talk slides built from Markdown source via [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)
- 🌙 Dark/light mode with theme persistence
- 🖥️ Terminal/hacker aesthetic with matrix rain background
- 📡 RSS feed, sitemap, SEO-friendly
- ⚡ 100% static output

## Quick Start

```sh
bun install
bun run dev       # Start dev server at localhost:4321
bun run build     # Build slides + site to ./dist/
bun run preview   # Preview the built site
```

## Adding Content

### New Blog Post

Create `src/content/blog/<slug>.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Title"
description: "A short description"
pubDate: "2026-02-25"
tags: ["dotnet", "csharp"]
---

Your content here...
```

The post appears automatically on the home page, blog listing, and RSS feed.

### New Presentation (with slides)

1. Create a folder: `talks/<category>/<Talk Name>/`
2. Add `presentation.md` (reveal-md Markdown slides)
3. Add `meta.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "slug": "my-talk",
     "tag": "Topic"
   }
   ```

Run `bun run build` — slides are auto-discovered, built, and shown on the talks page and home page.

### New Past Talk (no slides)

Add an entry to the `speakingLog` array in `src/pages/talks.astro`:

```js
{ date: "2026-01", title: "Talk Title", venue: "Event Name", url: "https://..." }
```

The `url` field is optional — omit it for talks without an external link.
