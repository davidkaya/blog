title: "Why Every Developer Should Give a Talk"
description: "Giving technical talks isn't just for conference speakers. Here's why presenting — even a 5-minute lightning talk — will make you a better engineer."

## The fear is universal

Everyone is nervous before their first talk. And their second. And probably their tenth. That's normal. The question isn't "will I be nervous?" — it's "is it worth doing anyway?"

**Yes. Absolutely yes.**

## What you gain

### 1. Deeper understanding

You don't truly understand something until you can explain it. Preparing a talk forces you to fill in the gaps in your knowledge:

```
What you think you know
    ↓ prepare a talk
What you actually know (it's less)
    ↓ research to fill gaps
What you know now (it's more than before)
```

### 2. Better communication skills

Software engineering is a team sport. The ability to explain complex ideas clearly is arguably more valuable than the ability to write clever code.

### 3. Career opportunities

People remember speakers. After giving talks at local meetups, I've had:

- Job offers from audience members
- Invitations to speak at larger events
- Collaborations on open source projects

## Start small

You don't need a 45-minute conference talk. Start with:

- **5-minute lightning talk** at a team meeting
- **10-minute show-and-tell** at a local meetup
- **Blog post** that you convert into slides later

> The best time to give your first talk was a year ago. The second best time is now.

## Practical tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Live-code if possible | Audiences love seeing code written in real-time |
| Have a demo that works | Test it 3 times before presenting |
| Use large fonts | The person in the back row matters too |
| Tell stories | "We had a production bug where..." beats "The API has these methods..." |

The developer community is incredibly supportive. Your audience *wants* you to succeed. So go sign up for that meetup slot.
